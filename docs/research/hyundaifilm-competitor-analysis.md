## 4. Digital experience & information architecture (hyundaifilm.com)

### 4.1 High‑level IA (Thai + EN combined from footer & hero)

- Home
- Company / About Us
- Products / Shop
- Introduction (concept / overview of interior film)
- Spec Sheet
- Catalogue / E‑Catalogue (PDFs)
- Installation Guide / Installation Video
- Project / Gallery
- Contact Us
- Login (probably for WordPress / WooCommerce account)

**Notable:**

- Structure strongly reflects **classic industrial B2B site** pattern: product > spec > downloads > gallery > contact.
- EN and TH versions share similar IA with duplicated content.

### 4.2 Home page content

- Hero: "Interior Film BODAQ" + CTA to **Our Product / Shop**.
- Short copy: sales leadership, sole representative in SEA, quick summary of what interior film is.
- Section: "ABOUT PRODUCT / E‑Catalogue / Installation Video" – 3 CTAs.
- Section: value props about **popularity**, **variety (>400 patterns)**, **clean & fast installation**, **flexibility for curved/3D surfaces**.
- Section: "ผลงานของเรา / Project" – grid of case studies with category filter.
- Footer: dense link list (many legacy URLs, both TH and EN), full addresses, phones, emails.

### 4.3 Project / Gallery

- Long grid of **featured items** grouped by category, each with small detail page.
- Filters by vertical (department store, shop, hospital, etc.).
- Mostly **image‑driven but with very shallow description** – limited story about design problem, solution, before/after.

### 4.4 Content quality & UX observations

- **Pros**
  - Plenty of **real project references**; broad proof of experience across sectors.
  - Clear articulation of **technical benefits**, environment & safety info.
  - Contact page lists **network of distributors** in region, with addresses and emails.

- **Cons / pain points**
  - **Visual & UX outdated** (WordPress‑ish, duplicated sections, inline CSS ID noise like `#text-2895798506`).
  - Navigation is **redundant and inconsistent** (multiple "Catalogue" / "Introduction" / "Contact" links in footer; mix of TH/EN URLs).
  - **No obvious structured product catalogue UI** on the website itself:
    - Patterns lists are not clearly navigable by **color, texture, price band, application, performance level**.
    - E‑Catalogue is mostly **PDF-based** (offline thinking), not digital‑native browsing.
  - **Low emphasis on storytelling**:
    - Case studies: mostly names and categories, almost no narrative about business impact.
    - No strong focus on ROI, downtime reduction, renovation vs rebuild cost comparison.
  - **Lead capture is basic**:
    - Simple "Contact us" form, no segmented flows (e.g. "Architect", "Business owner", "Homeowner").
    - No instant quoting tools, no approximate pricing calculator.
  - **SEO / Content depth**:
    - Limited educational content beyond basic descriptions and static introduction.
    - Little content targeting long‑tail questions (e.g. maintenance, comparison to laminates, cost vs repainting, acoustic / thermal aspects).

## 5. Strengths vs weaknesses (from Zenta’s perspective)

### 5.1 Strengths of Hyundaifilm / BODAQ

- **Strong principal brand** (Hyundai L&C) and long global track record.
- **Wide project portfolio** across many sectors in Thailand and SEA.
- **Comprehensive service** – stock, install, A/S, tools.
- **Clear technical & environmental positioning** – can win formal tenders and specification‑driven projects.
- **Category leadership** – likely dominates mindshare among older generation of specifiers/contractors.

### 5.2 Weaknesses / gaps

- **Brand experience is "old school"**:
  - Visual design and digital presence feel dated; not aspirational for younger designers.
- **Digital tools are minimal**:
  - No pattern finder, visualizer, or structured catalogue on web.
- **Persona journeys are not tailored**:
  - Architects, contractors, homeowners all see the same site.
- **Content is tech‑heavy but not decision‑centric**:
  - Many claims but few clear frameworks to help users choose series/pattern vs alternatives.
- **Limited transparency**:
  - No indication of price ranges, warranty terms, installation process steps, typical project timelines.

## 6. Strategic implications for Zenta (Thailand)

### 6.1 Positioning opportunity

- Take position as **"next‑generation interior film brand"** for Thailand:
  - Design‑driven, digital‑first, environment‑conscious.
  - Strong in **experience & tools**, not just material.
- Where Hyundaifilm is **legacy + proven**, Zenta can be **agile + modern + user‑centric**.

### 6.2 Content & messaging angle

- Emphasise **clarity in decision making**:
  - Explain **how to choose** films for each use case (retail, hospitality, healthcare, office, home).
  - Provide **comparisons**: interior film vs laminate vs painting; different series by durability & finish.
- Build **trust by transparency**:
  - Publish key specs in structured way.
  - Show process: before/after, total timeline, cost drivers.
- Position Zenta as **partner in design**, not just supplier:
  - Case studies that tell story: challenge → design approach → impact.

### 6.3 Digital product opportunity (website side)

- **Pattern / product explorer** with strong filters (color, pattern, substrate compatibility, fire rating, VOC level, budget band).
- **In‑browser visual inspiration**:
  - Moodboards, room presets, maybe simple 2D visualizer (later phase).
- **Segmented flows**:
  - Landing entry points: "สำหรับเจ้าของธุรกิจ", "สำหรับนักออกแบบ/สถาปนิก", "สำหรับเจ้าของบ้าน" with tailored CTAs and content.
- **Lead funnels** optimised:
  - Multi‑step contact/quote forms that capture project type, area, location, timeframe, budget range.
  - Clear prompts for **sample kit requests** and **showroom visits**.
- **Knowledge hub** on interior film category:
  - Maintenance, cleaning, standards, code compliance, best practices.

## 7. Key guiding principles for building a superior Zenta website

1. **Persona‑first IA** – structure navigation and content around how Thai users decide on interior film, not around company org chart.
2. **Interactive, structured catalogue** – replace PDF‑first thinking with searchable, filterable product data.
3. **Story‑rich case studies** – elevate from gallery of photos → business value stories (traffic uplift, brand perception, downtime saved, etc.).
4. **Transparent process & expectations** – step‑by‑step process, lead times, what to prepare, what happens on site.
5. **SEO & education as acquisition engine** – build a library of Thai‑language guides that capture search demand.
6. **B2B enablement** – dedicated area for architects/contractors with specs, CAD/BIM (later), and tender documentation.
